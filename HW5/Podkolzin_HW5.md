# HW 5 - Reflection
Miriam Podkolzin

### Design

1. As a team we didn't thoroughly discuss various design methods we were going to follow. Since our team didn't have a solid foundation on how we were going to approach our use cases, we were unsure of where to begin. It's most helpful to think about design methods for a project so that the appropriate pattern is used for the problem. It's also helpful to compare and contrast design methods to help uncover pros and cons for your project. 

2. The most difficult was discussing how our components interacted with each other. In the future, I would try to gain more information on the subject matter of what platform to use etc. We had somewhat consistant trouble with slack API since it has recently been updated. I didn't know of the recent update until I started the project and had run into an error.

3. The adapter pattern seems like a reasonable design method to use in the future. This would've worked well with our project since the adapter pattern is used when there is a breaking change in versions of API or library but donâ€™t want to force client to accommodate.


### Testing

1. A youtube video on how to setup slack bots was the most helpful in implementing our bot. It walked us through the steps on how to make an app on slack api and how to connect it. It did a great job with explanations. Testing wise, our group hasn't done a majority of testing. We've testing interaction with our bot on slack and tested pulling data from TopCoder API. We're still working on integration so it's difficult to say what has been the most helpful. Mainly online resources, like tutorials are the most helpful.

2. The most difficult parts, for me personally, are always the little things. The bot token causing an error because slack API had updated to new Oath system was frusturating. Once I understood it, the problem became easier to manage. I would definitely read sites more in depth. I had found a discussion board that reviewed the exact problem I was dealing with but I never took the time to really process the discussion. I only truly read and understood the discussion when I became very frusturated with the problem. Definitely a habit I want to work on. 

3. Again, since our group has not done a great deal with testing and integration, we have no methods that we've really followed through on. With implementation, I would definitely use the method of following tutorials. It brings me ease because it feels like I'm working on the project with whoever is leading the tutorial. I frequent method I had was asking Professor Yang for help. It's definitely something I would do again in the future considering our team struggled with discussing how to go about implementation and especially integration. Professor Yang provides a great transfer of knowledge that was very useful to our group. 


### Process

1. I LOVED implementing the kanban. It was incredibly helpful for me to see our tasks organized into categories. It's definitely efficient when it comes to communication. I think it also kept our team motivation up since we wanted to move all the tasks to the Done column. Code review wasn't incredibly helpful for our group. We were not really overlapping in code nor were we writing complex code. It became most helpful when group members were running into errors. Then we could easily screenshare and troubleshoot together. This was a very quick process. We never spent excessive amounts of time code reviewing. (We don't have that much code haha).

2. Most difficult was assigning point values to our tasks on our kanban board. Our group had never done a project like this so we had no experience to go off of when assigning points to our tasks. I'm sure when doing a familiar project, assigning points would be easier and more helpful to task priority. To help with this, I would've loked into and/or tried to understand the tasks more (execution wise). As a team we specialized in our own individual tasks. This again made it harder to compare tasks within our point system. 

3. I would definitely use making use cases into tasks on a kanban board approach again. This was so effective for keeping a team on the same page and up to date. I also would want to implement the frequent scrum meetings. They're much more pleasent and efficient than having 1.5 hour meetings with discussion on how our project pieces together. Scrum meetings also help keep morale high. They make me excited to move forward and work on the project. 

### Overall

Videos and tutorials from the implementation would be useful in design with dicussing and understanding design methods. There are numerous design methods. Even when we did our activity with design methods at the beginning of the semester it was still hard for me to understand and even differentiate them sometimes. Watching videos and gaining information is an approach that can be used stages beyond just implementation. A kanban board could also be used to keep track of possible design methods the team wants to implement. A design method could be assigned to a team member to be looked into. The kanban board can definitely be used for any distribution of work.
