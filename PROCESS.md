After reevaluations and help from Professor Yang the team decided to create a slack topcoder bot. Thus, the team did not use botpress. This task was eliminated from the kanban board.

### **Meeting Notes: April 14, 2020**

Decided to pivot from separately hosted bot to slack bot
  Possibly still connection firebase to save user scores if possible. If not, leaderboard will hopefully come from topcoder api

Decided to continue to try using topcoder api to access requests from slackbot

Shifted priorities with use cases, will no longer monitor the quality of the submissions 
  However, can get descriptions of the achievements. will if get time assign points to achievements 
  
Will attempt to still monitor user submissions and leaderboard.
