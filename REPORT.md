# Milestone: Report


## The problem Reward Bot solved
Crowdsourcing is a modern solution to challenges of a modern technical world. It allows companies to reach a wide variety of ideas at an extremely low cost, since they no longer are tied to the solutions of a couple salaried workers. However, issues arise when trying to make cohesive solutions from scattered ideas. We aim to address two closely related issues, that of low audience participation and the quality of solutions submitted, viewed through the frame of TopCoder, a software crowdsourcing platform. 

TopCoder is a great platform to encompass real coding challenges, but as a freelance type forum it faces issues with priority. Many people can contribute, but when they have other jobs or life commitments to attend outside of the TopCoder challenges, these projects can fall to the wayside. When priority suffers, even when developers manage to devote time to solving an issue, since the feeling of responsibility is eroded in this low stakes environment, the solution achieved may not be practical, efficient, or effective. These issues of quality and quantity are intertwined, and we hope to contribute to a solution with our reward bot.

#### 3. Ability to reward points to a specified user for starting / finishing a TopCoder problem. 
Note: Starting a problem is awarded less points as it is a minor action whereas finishing a problem is a major action.
